# Pokemon Royal Red
The timeless Kanto region under a new reign!

## Installation

To get the .ups patch, look to the right to find the latest release of the patch.

Do not click the source code folders; click the file named "PokemonRoyalRed".

You will need a FireRed ROM and the .ups patch at hand. This FireRed ROM should be from the USA reigon, as other languages are not supported at this time.

The hack does not support Revision 1 copies. You can check if it is a Rev 1 game if, when the game is started, the word "PRESENTS" is under the GameFreak logo.

Now that you have you supplies ready, [visit this web-based ROM patcher](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/). 
First, put the basic FireRed ROM into the "ROM File" area. Next, put Pokemon Royal Red.ups into the "Patch file" area.

The screen should look like this. Press "Apply patch" now.

You should now have a new GBA file downloaded to your PC. Rename it to "Pokemon Royal Red".

Congratulations! It has successfully installed.

# Bug Reports

If you find anything wrong with the game, please search if it's an issue with base FireRed first. Make sure that the ROM you used was correct (see **Installation**)

Bugs that are caused by bad ROMs include glitched text in the move menu, and items not appearing in the bag.

VBA-M has difficulties with the RTC clock feature. Using the mGBA emulator or the mGBA core used in RetroArch is advised.

If you still want to use VBA-M, go to Options > Game Boy Advance, and enable RTC. Then, in that same menu, go to configure, and change the save type to Flash and the flash size to 128kb.

If you are sure there is something wrong with the hack, please submit a issue report and I will attend to it as soon as possible.
